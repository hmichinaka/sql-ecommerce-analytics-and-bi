In the end, a series of case-study analyses was done as the Final Project to utilize what I learned from this repository.

## Final Project

### Situation
CEO is clsoe to secure next round of funding. As an analyst, I help CEO to tell a compalling story of rapid growth to investors.

### Key findings 
- 3 years after we launched the first product, the website sessions and incoming orders dramatically and continuously increased. The sessions are 34 times and the orders are 90 times more than the first month of sale.
- When the company introduced the second product and cross-sold the products in 2013-Q1, all the conversion rate, the revenue per order and the revenue per session increased by 10-30 % for each.
- Our brand has been developed over the 3 years. About one-third of the orders come from the following channels: brans search, organic search and direct type-in.
- The conversion rate of all the channels increased as well up to 250 % over the 3 years. A significant improvement can be observed in 2013-Q1 when the second product is introduced.
- For all 4 products, the revenue has its peak at Nov. and Dec. every year. This is because of the holiday season (in the U.S.). Product #2 “The Forever Love Bear” has an additional strong peak in Feb. due to Valentine's Day.
- Even though we introduced multiple products over the years, the click-through rate from /products page and the conversion rate kept increasing. 
- Product #4 “The Hudson River Mini Bear” has a lower price point and cross-sold well with other products. 

### Recommendations

- As product #2 is doing so well by targeting a holiday, it would make sense to introduce other seasonal products. At the same time, promotional marketing activities before holidays depending on the products is also recommended to maximise our revenue.
- As a lower-priced product #4 is cross-sold well, I propose to increase our product lineups in a lower- and mid-priced range. However, we have to keep tracking some performance such as click-through rate and conversion rate to make sure that new products do not give a negative effect on our overall performance (so far we are doing good until product #4).
- I want to make sure that we are effectively spending our marketing costs. The channel growth was confirmed but I can also compare nonbrand and brand channels to their marketing cost so that we do not overspend for them in the long term.
